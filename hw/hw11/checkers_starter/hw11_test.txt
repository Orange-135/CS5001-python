61 Which functions you tested for Part 1
61 A summary of valid inputs (inputs for which you'd expect a 'good' result) and expected return values
61 A summary of invalid inputs (inputs for which you'd expect a 'bad' result) and expected return values

Within checker.py
I want to create test_update(), test_die(), and test_render(). I will create checker object among all test functions.
- For the test_update(), I will use isMoveable() function to test whether it can be moveable. If it can be moveable, return true; if not moveable, return false.
- For the test_die(), I will test if the checker dies(checker.x/y == -1) and become invisible(if invisible, return true).
-For the test_render(), I will test if the checker is rendered correctly.

Within board.py
I want to create test_getClickedChecker(), test_update(), test_render(). I will create board object among all test functions.
-For the test_getClickedChecker(), I will test if the correct Checker object is returned when getClickedChecker() is called.
-For the test_update(), I will test if the game_object list is updated correctly and if the attributes the 'checker' objects in the updated 'game_object' list match the expected values.
-For the test_render(), I will test if the render() method is called on each Checker object in the game_object list.


61 Whether you're confident you've verified every possible eventuality
Consider using parameterized testing to test multiple sets of different inputs to increase test coverage.


61 Whether your testing revealed any bugs that you then went back and fixed.
During the testing process, if any errors were discovered in the code, they can be located and fixed based on the failures of assertions and error messages from the tests
